<h1>Playoff Cup</h1>
<p>Playoff Cup pits 16 fictional hockey teams against each other to battle through 4 playoff rounds to win the coveted Playoff Cup. The first round is the Division Semifinal, where your selected team will play another team at random in the same Division. A best-of-seven games series will determine the winner to go on to the Division Final. Upon winning the Division Final, your team can compete in the Conference Final, and then the Playoff Cup Final.
